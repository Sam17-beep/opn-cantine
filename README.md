# Cantine

## Tech stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Chakra UI v3
- MongoDB (native driver)
- TypeScript

## Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in `app/`:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGODB_DB=cantine
BASIC_AUTH_USER=<your-username>
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=<your-strong-password>
ADMIN_PIN=<your-pin>
```

### Local development (optional)

To open the tab page without a physical card reader, enable dev mode. When
`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE` is `true`, a button appears on the home page that opens the tab
page for `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_CARD_NUMBER`, auto-creating a default employee if it doesn't
exist. Leave these unset/false in production.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_CARD_NUMBER=000000000000
```

## Getting started

```bash
cd app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Tests

```bash
cd app
pnpm test        # single run
pnpm test:watch  # watch mode
```

The suite runs against a real MongoDB started in-process by
`mongodb-memory-server` — no Docker or running database needed. The first run
downloads a MongoDB binary (~80 MB) and caches it.

Three layers, all under `src`:

- `lib/domain/inventory-rules.test.ts` — pure rules (which barcodes are
  inventory-tracked, sale-id validation).
- `lib/infrastructure/repositories/idempotent-writes.test.ts` — proves the
  atomic conditional updates are exactly-once, including under concurrent
  duplicates.
- `lib/application/services/sale.application.service.test.ts` — the drift
  invariants end to end, plus a randomised reconciliation test that replays
  concurrent carts and asserts stock, tab and ledger still agree.
- `lib/client/useBarcodeScanner.test.tsx` — renders the hook against real DOM
  events, including scans typed while the hidden input has lost focus.

Suites that render React opt into jsdom with a `// @vitest-environment jsdom`
docblock; everything else runs in Node, which keeps the rest fast.

These exist to stop the [inventory drift](#recording-a-sale) bugs from coming
back. If you change how sales are written, the reconciliation test is the one to
trust: it fails on any mismatch between what the ledger says was sold and what
actually left the shelf.

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

App runs on `http://localhost:3000` with MongoDB on `localhost:27017`.

```bash
docker compose down

## Seasonal themes

In **Admin → Thèmes**, select **Classique**, **Halloween**, or **Hiver / Noël**, then choose
**Appliquer le thème**. The preview does not change the live app until saved.
Classique is the default and restores the original appearance.

The choice is shared across devices and survives reloads: MongoDB stores it in
`settings`, in the document with `_id: "appearance"`. `GET /api/theme` reads the
current theme; `PUT /api/theme` requires an admin session and accepts only known
theme IDs. No migration is needed.

Open devices refresh the theme every minute while visible and when returning
to the app. A failed refresh keeps the last loaded appearance without
interrupting sales; synchronization errors are logged and shown in the theme
admin page. Halloween uses dark plum surfaces, muted amber accents, and
illustrated pumpkins, a scarecrow, and bats in the background.
Hiver / Noël (`winter`) uses frosty blue surfaces, evergreen accents, a decorated
Christmas tree, presents, a snowman, and snowflakes. It uses light mode and keeps
the centered Cantine title without adding a subtitle.
The responsive scenery stays behind the content, never catches taps, and adds
no animation. Prices and announcements are unchanged; red/green status meanings
are preserved with dark-mode contrast. Classique always restores light mode,
regardless of the device's system appearance. The theme registry defines each
theme's color mode and browser toolbar color alongside its label and description.

## Recording a sale

Every sale goes through a single endpoint, `POST /api/sales`, which writes the
transaction, charges the employee tab and decrements stock as one unit of work:

```json
{
  "saleId": "<uuid generated by the client, one per cart>",
  "cardNumber": "000000000000",
  "totalAmount": 7.5,
  "items": [{ "barcode": "1234", "name": "Chips", "price": 2.5, "quantity": 3, "productId": "..." }]
}
```

The call is **idempotent**: the `saleId` keys the transaction `_id` and guards
every side effect, so a client may retry the exact same payload safely. Retries
never double-charge and never decrement stock twice.

Two rules keep inventory and transactions in sync:

- The tab is never charged and stock is never moved without a transaction row —
  the ledger entry is written first, and it is the only write path.
- Stock is **not** clamped at zero. Selling more units than the count claims
  leaves a negative quantity, which surfaces as a `warnings` entry and a restock
  to do, instead of silently absorbing the difference.
- In **Admin → Produits**, a negative quantity can be selected, erased, and
  replaced with the physical count. The completed correction must be a
  non-negative whole number; an in-progress empty field is kept while typing
  so `-5` can actually be replaced.

### Price check

`/price` is a read-only lookup reached from the home screen: scan an item, see
its price, nothing is billed and no account is involved. It returns to the home
screen after 45 s idle so the next person does not find a stranger's lookup.

Every screen that reads a barcode shares `useBarcodeScanner`, so the tab, the
cash register and the price check agree on what counts as a scan. The scanner
has no Enter key on some models, which is why a burst of keystrokes faster than
a human can type is submitted on its own after a short pause; those thresholds
live in `lib/client/barcode-scan.ts` and are unit tested.

The scanner is a keyboard: it types into whatever holds focus. Anything that
takes focus away — tapping "Café", dismissing a dialog — used to send the next
scan nowhere, and because a partial or empty code is silently discarded the item
simply never appeared, with nothing on screen and nothing in the journal to say
why. Refocusing the input on click or on blur only helps once such an event
happens, by which point the keystrokes are gone.

So `useBarcodeScanner` also listens for keystrokes on the document. If a digit
arrives while the hidden input is not focused, it pulls focus back and keeps the
character. It stands down while a real field is focused, and while a dialog is
open, so a quantity box keeps its own digits: pages pass `isScannerEnabled`, a
predicate read at each keystroke rather than a flag, because the answer depends
on hooks that run later in the component.

The code being assembled is held in a ref as well as in React state, since the
handlers must not depend on a re-render having happened: a scanner delivers a
whole barcode in a few milliseconds. Codes too short to look up are reported as
`scan_dropped` in the journal — their previous silence is what made this hard to
diagnose. A misread that stops after a digit or two is cleared once the burst
goes quiet, so it cannot prefix the next scan into a nonexistent barcode.

### Slow connections

A slow network widens two windows where a scan used to disappear.

The screens render nothing until their first request comes back, so on a slow
connection the hidden input does not exist yet. The document listener keeps
those keystrokes anyway and submits them once the page is up.

More seriously, the sale payload is serialised when the save starts, and the
screen redirects home when it returns. With retries that gap can last seconds,
and anything scanned inside it was added to a cart that was already on its way
out — taken off the shelf, never billed, never deducted: the same
[inventory drift](#recording-a-sale) by another route. The save flows now expose
`saving`, and the cart turns those scans away with a message on screen and a
`scan_dropped` entry rather than swallowing them.

A scan is never instant, and on the device the lookup has been seen to take a
couple of seconds. Nothing on screen said so, which reads exactly like a missed
scan and invites the operator to scan again. The screens now show a spinner and
"Recherche du produit…" while a lookup is in flight. It is driven by a *count*
of outstanding lookups, not a flag: a scanner fires faster than the network
answers, so overlapping lookups are normal and a flag would hide the spinner
when the first response landed rather than the last.

`scan` and `scan_unknown` entries record `durationMs`, so the journal can tell a
slow scan apart from one that never arrived.

The 15 s inactivity auto-logout is **paused while a lookup is in flight**. A
pending scan means the operator is still standing there and an item is still on
its way into the cart; saving at that moment would serialise the payload without
it, and the article would leave the shelf unbilled — the
[drift](#recording-a-sale) again. The delay starts over from full once the
lookup lands, rather than resuming where it left off.

That makes a stuck request dangerous in a new way: it would hold the session,
and an employee's tab, on a shared screen indefinitely. So the lookup is bounded
by a 10 s `AbortSignal.timeout`; a timeout is reported as `lookup_timeout` in
the journal.

### Cash payments

Cash sales (`/cash`) use the same endpoint with the sentinel card `_cash_`.
They write a ledger row and decrement stock exactly as a tab sale does, but
charge no tab, so `employee` comes back `null` and `tabApplied` is `false`.

They must not be routed to `POST /api/transactions`: that path is an admin-only
backfill which deliberately touches neither the tab nor stock, so recording a
cash sale there sells the item without ever decrementing it — silent drift.

The response reports `issues` (sold but stock did not move — this should always
be empty) and `warnings` (applied, but stock is now negative). Both are logged
server-side, and each transaction stores its per-product `inventory` outcome so
stock movements can be reconciled against the ledger at any time.

Barcodes starting with `_` (`_cafe_`, `_event_`) are quick-add items: billed,
but intentionally not inventory-tracked.

### Sale screens

The tab and cash screens are the same shape, and both fit one iPad screen: they
are a fixed-height column (`100dvh`, `overflow: hidden`) where only the item
list flexes, so the totals and the save button stay put and are never scrolled
out of reach. The operator serves people standing at a counter; a control that
has to be scrolled to is a control that gets missed.

Scanned items render through the shared `ScannedItemList` so the list on the
page and the recap in the confirmation dialog cannot drift apart. The recap
passes no `onEdit` and is therefore inert: nothing inside the dialog can change
the cart while the total sitting next to it says otherwise.

## Action log (on-device)

The kiosk keeps a local, append-only trail of what happened on it: login, scan,
quick-add, item edits, save/confirm/cancel, auto-logout and disconnect. It is
meant for debugging after the fact — one shared iPad, so the actions are
strictly sequential.

Read and export it from **Admin → Journal**, on the device in question.

- **Stored in IndexedDB**, not localStorage: appends happen on the barcode-scan
  hot path, and localStorage is synchronous and string-only, so every append
  would re-serialise the whole log on the main thread. IndexedDB's
  auto-incrementing key also *is* the sequence number.
- **Sequence, not timestamps, defines order.** `seq` is monotonic; `at` is the
  device clock and can jump.
- **Capped at 50 000 entries**, oldest dropped, so the origin never bloats.
  That is roughly 10 MB of NDJSON (an entry serialises to about 200 bytes) and
  covers about two weeks even on a busy day — a bug reported on Monday is still
  in the log. The cap is sized for retention rather than storage: trimming only
  deletes the overflow, so a larger cap costs nothing at write time.
- **Card numbers are redacted to the last four digits**, and PINs/tokens are
  dropped, by the log itself rather than by each call site. An export can be
  mailed around; it must not be a list of working credentials.
- **Exports as NDJSON** (one entry per line), so a partial copy still parses and
  `grep` works on it.
- **Best-effort by design.** Storage can be unavailable, full, or evicted;
  logging failures are swallowed and never interrupt a sale.

Sale entries carry the `saleId`, which is the same id used as the transaction
`_id` server-side — that is what lets a client trail be lined up against the
ledger.

Actions fired from a React effect must use `logActionOnce(key, type, detail)`:
StrictMode invokes effects twice in development, and effects re-run whenever
their dependencies change, so `logAction` alone would record duplicates. The
key is namespaced by session id, so the next login records again on its own.

For the same reason `startSession()` is always called at the point that
navigates to a kiosk screen, never in that screen's mount effect: it mints a
new id, so an effect running twice would both duplicate the entry and split one
visit across two session ids.

Cash payments share these types and carry `mode: 'cash'`, so a cash visit can
be told apart from a tab visit with a plain `grep`. A cash visit opens with
`cash_open` rather than `login`, since nobody identifies themselves.
